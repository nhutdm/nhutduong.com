Hello, I'm Nhut Duong, a full stack developer and consultant.

I started my journey as a software engineer in 2012, and now, I'm a technical consultant at Bosch Digital. Before this, I was a front-end software engineer at DXC Technology. I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, with my wonderful wife and our two kidsâ€”a son and a daughter.

Driven by a passion for technology, I love exploring cutting-edge tools, open-source projects, and innovative side projects. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, where I create scalable solutions and impactful digital experiences. I strive to align technology with business goals, delivering exceptional results.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me running and swimming to stay fit, riding my motorbike to discover new spots, and traveling to explore new horizons. I'm also a movie enthusiast and a data hoarder, always gathering insights that spark inspiration.

Let's connect if you're looking for a dedicated full stack developer and consultant who leverages technology to create value. I'm excited to help bring your vision to life.
