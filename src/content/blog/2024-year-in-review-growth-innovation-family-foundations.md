2024 has been a year of transformation, filled with significant achievements both professionally and personally. This year marked key milestones in my career and personal life, and in this post, I'll reflect on the major moments that defined my year.

## Professional Achievements

### Revolutionizing User Experience

In 2024, I faced the challenge of low customer satisfaction ratings for our SAP-based enterprise solution. This led to an innovative approach to user feedback, where I:

- Designed interactive feedback mechanisms at key touchpoints
- Led comprehensive UI/UX improvement discussions
- Shifted from passive feedback collection to active user engagement

**Result:** Customer satisfaction ratings soared from 2.3 to 4.3 stars on our platformâ€”a true testament to the power of user-centered innovation.

### Technical Leadership and Project Management

As the non-SAP and cloud systems integration lead, I successfully managed multiple complex projects, ensuring high standards of delivery. Some highlights include:

- Successfully managing parallel integration projects
- Gained knowledge on Java, Elasticsearch, and Spring Boot through collaborative sessions with colleagues in India
- Developing Google Data Studio dashboards for real-time performance monitoring

This was a year of strong teamwork, technical leadership, and consistent execution, all of which led to positive customer feedback and internal recognition.

### Starting My Blogging Journey

2024 was the year I finally started blogging, something I had been planning for a long time. Using the Astro framework hosted on Cloudflare Pages, I launched my personal website to share knowledge and insights related to my career and professional challenges. This journey has allowed me to connect with others, contribute to their growth, and further reflect on my own experiences.

## Personal Growth

### Creating Our Family Home

On the personal side, 2024 marked an important milestone as my family and I moved into our own rental apartment near my parents' house. This transition allowed us to:

- Establish new family routines and traditions
- Provide a nurturing space for our children to grow
- Maintain strong ties with extended family

This wasn't just a physical move; it was about creating a space for connection and new beginnings, strengthening our family's foundation.

### Prioritizing Health and Wellness

Health was a major focus for me in 2024. Through consistent effort, I lost 9 kg, going from 75 kg to 66 kg. This transformation was largely thanks to a new weekend routine: swimming with my son. Not only did this activity improve my fitness, but it also deepened our bond, creating lasting memories together.

### Strategic Investments: Planning for the Future

In 2024, I took a strategic step toward long-term financial stability by investing in a new apartment in Long An Province. This investment is about:

- Securing a long-term financial future
- Taking advantage of emerging real estate opportunities
- Establishing roots in a developing area with growth potential

This decision represents both a financial strategy and a long-term plan for my family's future.

## Lessons Learned and Growth

Looking back, 2024 taught me valuable lessons:

- **Proactive problem-solving**: Addressing challenges head-on leads to rewarding outcomes
- **Balancing priorities**: Balancing personal milestones with professional growth is essential
- **Strategic planning**: Patience and adaptability are crucial when planning for the future
- **Family connections**: Staying close to loved ones while fostering independence is a delicate but rewarding balance

## Looking Forward to 2025

As I reflect on 2024, I'm excited for what lies ahead in 2025. My goals include:

- Leading research into next-generation SAP-based enterprise solution
- Driving innovation in user experience with emerging technologies
- Exploring new technical frontiers with my team
- Further developing our family home and nurturing family bonds
- Managing and monitoring our property investment
- Getting SAP Certificates for SAP Fiori and SAP BTP to enhance my technical expertise

I look forward to embracing new opportunities, challenges, and milestones in the year ahead.

## Conclusion

2024 has been a year of significant growth, both professionally and personally. From enhancing user experiences at work to creating new foundations for my family, each step has been an important part of my journey. I am deeply thankful for the unwavering support from my wife, who has been my rock throughout the year, and my children, who bring joy and motivation to my life every day.
